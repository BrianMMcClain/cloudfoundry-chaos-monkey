In this example, we'll use CFCM on an application named `myapp`, keeping between 2 and 5 instances. We want CFCM to have a 30% chance of adding or removing an instance every 10 seconds. Adding and removeing instances is known as \"soft mode\", that is, this is equvilant to doing \"vmc instane [app] -1\". There is a \"hard mode\" planned that is a bit more chaotic.\r\n\r\n`cfcm soft [email] [password] myapp --min 2 --max 5 -p 30 -f 10`\r\n\r\nIt's as easy as that!","tagline":"Chaos Monkey style service for Cloud Foundry"}
